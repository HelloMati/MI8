## Overview
---

Welcome to the MI8 group project. Our text based adventure will take you through a dangerous mission with a single objective, to take down an international crime syndicate.

Using our skills learnt during the first 5 weeks of our bootcamp our API will have a series of HTTP requests to help you navigate this dangerous mission, whilst showcasing our understanding of APIs, 

### The challenge
---
Our MVP was to create a server-side, back-end project with the use of the following technologies/frameworks:


- Java
- Spring Boot
- An SQL database
- Maven 

With the use of Springboot we set out to create an API that would consolidate the knowledge we gathered and create a game. This game sets out to contain interconnected objects as well as bespoke methods which can affect the game-state.

## Our process
---
The initial process started with narrowing down the scope of our project to an achievable MVP in the 72 hours we had.

we established an MVP which we succesfully achieved as well as some extensions. Those extensions were discarding items and including a mission.
